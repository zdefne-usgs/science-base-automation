On the ocean-facing side of the island, this was considered the MHW contour (Weber and others 2005, Zeigler and others 2019). To include partially submerged wetland on the estuarine-side, the land-facing shoreline was delineated at mean tidal level (MTL), which was calculated from the local MHW and mean low water (MLW) levels at the given study area.\n\nThe local MLW elevation was estimated from NOAA&#8217;s VDatum (2014 release) as the average MLW elevation at a sample of nearshore points in the study area. Experimentation conducted as part of this study found that the MTL delineation more consistently identified the boundary between marsh (intertidal vegetation) and submerged areas than either MHW or MLW. For consistency with the MHW offset applied throughout the project, MHW was used as part of the calculation of MTL.\n\nTo create this shoreline, we performed the following steps. Most of the steps were performed programmatically using the function functions_warcpy.DEMtoFullShorelinePoly in bi-transect-extractor (Sturdivant, 2018):\n\n1. Manually digitize lines from the DEM that indicate where land meets a tidal inlet, which is considered the division point between the oceanside and the bayside or estuarine side of the island. This line was visually approximated.\n\n2. Create a generalized polygon from the DEM in which every cell within the polygon is above MHW (MHW polygon). This was performed programmatically using the function functions_warcpy.RasterToLandPerimeter in bi-transect-extractor v1.0 (Sturdivant, 2018) with a MHW elevation of {} m NAVD88, calculated for the area by Weber and others (2005). The process includes generalizing the polygons (Aggregate Polygons tool in the Cartography toolbox) using an aggregation distance of 10 m, a minimum area of 300 m, and a minimum hole size of 300 m.\n\n3. Repeat Step 3 for MTL, using an MTL elevation of {} m NAVD88.\n\n4. Merge the polygons so that the MHW contour outlines the island on the oceanside and the MTL contour outlines the island on the bayside, divided at the delineated tidal inlets. To do so, create a symmetrical difference polygon between MHW and MTL polygons (SymDiff) and split the resulting polygon at the inlet lines (Feature to Polygon). Create a polygon that outlines only the bayside area that is above MTL and below MHW (MTL-only polygon) by manually deleting the segments of the symmetrical difference polygon that pertain to the ocean-side of the island. Merge the MTL-only polygon with the MHW polygon (Union, Dissolve). This was performed using the function functions_warcpy.CombineShorelinePolygons in bi-transect-extractor (Sturdivant, 2018).\n\n5. QA/QC the output and manually revise any sections with clearly incorrect artifacts.\n\nThe dataset contains {} polygons.</procdesc>""".format(sycode, mhw, mtl, poly_ct)

## Execute
The master copy of the template spreadsheet is the Google Doc. Before running,
download it and change the csvfile variable below to the correct pathname.

How to execute:
1. Optionally duplicate the data folder. This code won't touch the data. It will save backup copies of the XMLs and then overwrite them.
2. Download the template table as CSV and save it in the basedir. Update the paths below.
3. Run the code below.

The code:
1. Creates a backup_xmls directory and saves a copy of the csv file there.
2. Parses the CSV to a DF.
3. Renames directories to the sycode in the template table that exactly matches the full name of Site, State, Year
